### Survey Note: Comprehensive Exploration of Jacque Fresco’s Views on AI

This survey note provides a detailed examination of videos and resources related to Jacque Fresco, the author of The Venus Project and advocate for a resource-based economy, focusing on his discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) and how it should function. Fresco, a futurist and social engineer, integrated AI and technology into his vision for a sustainable, equitable society, and this note compiles the available evidence to guide exploration of his ideas.

#### Background and Context
Jacque Fresco (March 13, 1916 – May 18, 2017) was an American futurist known for his work on The Venus Project, a non-profit organization proposing a resource-based economy. This system aims to use science and technology, including AI and automation, to achieve global abundance and sustainability. His ideas, detailed in lectures, interviews, and documentaries, often address how AI could eliminate scarcity and enhance societal well-being, aligning with his critique of monetary systems and traditional economics.

Research suggests that Fresco’s views on AI are embedded within his broader discussions on cybernetic technology and automation, as evidenced by his writings and public appearances. For instance, his work emphasizes a future where AI and robotics manage resources efficiently, reducing human labor and addressing issues like poverty and environmental degradation. This aligns with his advocacy for a society where technology serves human needs, potentially making money obsolete, as noted in a LinkedIn post by The Venus Project: “Eventually, with artificial intelligence, money may become irrelevant, particularly in a high-energy civilization” ([The Venus Project LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-venus-project_thevenusproject-resourcebasedeconomy-jacquefresco-activity-6865927409980592128-2qI3)).

#### Key Video Resources
The following videos and channels are identified as primary sources for exploring Fresco’s views on AI, based on their content and relevance:

1. **Singularity.FM Interview: “Jacque Fresco: Apply the Methods of Science to the Social System!”**

#### Additional Channels and Content
Beyond specific videos, Fresco’s ideas are accessible through dedicated YouTube channels:
- **Jacque Fresco Foundation Channel**: Managed by the foundation preserving his legacy, this channel ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/jacquefresco)) includes university lectures, television appearances, and interviews. While specific AI-focused videos were not directly identified, the channel’s description suggests content on technology and society, likely covering AI.
- **The Venus Project Channel**: This channel ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPNMR_iABvyFmc3G9i1r3Lw)) hosts documentaries and presentations, such as “Paradise or Oblivion,” and may include discussions on AI within its broader technological focus.

#### Evidence and Analysis
The evidence leans toward Fresco’s integration of AI into his vision, as seen in his lectures on cybernetic technology and automation, as noted in his Wikipedia entry ([Jacque Fresco Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Fresco)). For example, a YouTube video titled “Jacque Fresco - Artificial Intelligence - Sunday's 'Time' (Russian) (2013)” ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT4gph5Oo2g)) indicates he discussed AI, though it is in Russian, limiting accessibility for English speakers. This suggests a need for English-language content, which is addressed by the documentaries and interviews listed.

Fresco’s ideas, while visionary, have faced controversy, with some viewing The Venus Project as utopian or impractical, as discussed in Reddit threads ([r/solarpunk Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/solarpunk/comments/xqh7b4/what_does_rsolarpunk_think_of_the_venus_project/)). However, his focus on AI as a tool for societal benefit remains a core aspect, supported by articles like one on Forbes discussing AI and robotics in The Venus Project’s future ([Forbes Article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielaraya/2020/09/01/is-the-venus-project-the-next-stage-in-human-evolution/)).
